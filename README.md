The project report, titled “Engagement Detection in a Classroom,” addresses the challenge educators face in consistently recognizing student engagement levels and emotional states using traditional observational methods. This problem is exacerbated by the dynamic and diverse nature of classroom environments, where subjective assessments can lead to inconsistent and biased results. To tackle this, the project proposes an innovative computer vision (CV) system designed to automatically analyze visual cues such as facial expressions, hand raises, and head movements. This system aims to provide real-time, unbiased feedback to educators, enabling them to adapt their teaching methods on the fly to better meet students’ needs.

The proposed solution leverages advanced CV techniques and deep learning models to monitor and interpret student behavior continuously. The system is designed to integrate seamlessly into classroom settings, capturing and analyzing visual data through strategically placed cameras. It employs models like MTCNN for face detection and MediaPipe for hand tracking to evaluate engagement and emotional states objectively. The real-time analytics generated by the system are displayed on an educator’s dashboard, offering insights into classroom dynamics and helping to identify students who may need additional support, thereby fostering a more inclusive and responsive learning environment.

This approach not only enhances the immediate educational experience by allowing for real-time adjustments but also scales effectively across multiple classrooms, providing a broader impact on educational practices. The deployment and maintenance of the system are streamlined to ensure minimal disruption, with continuous monitoring and regular updates to maintain efficacy and security. While the project acknowledges potential limitations, such as ethical concerns related to surveillance and the risk of over-reliance on technology, it ultimately positions the CV system as a powerful tool for transforming how student engagement and learning outcomes are measured and supported in modern educational settings.
